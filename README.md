# **Chatbot GPT Model**  

A chatbot project leveraging GPT models to answer both dataset-specific and general questions. This project includes three main scripts: a GPT-2 chatbot fine-tuned on a real estate dataset, a general-purpose chatbot using GPT-2, and an OpenAI API integration. The project highlights challenges with dataset integration and coherence generation, seeking valuable community insights and collaboration.

## **1. Introduction**  

Welcome to the **Chatbot GPT Model** project! This project aims to build a chatbot system using different GPT models to handle dataset-specific questions as well as general-purpose queries. The chatbot integrates Hugging Face’s `transformers` library and OpenAI's API but currently faces challenges regarding dataset integration and generating coherent and meaningful responses.

Your insights, suggestions, and contributions would be highly valuable in overcoming these issues.

## **2. Project Overview**  

This chatbot system is designed to:

- Analyze a dataset (real estate dataset).
- Generate chatbot responses for general queries about any topic.
- Integrate OpenAI’s GPT model via API for scalable solutions.

The project is divided into three main scripts:

1. **`gpt_model.ipynb`** – A chatbot that analyzes a dataset (`real_estate_data.csv`) and provides insights about property prices and locations.
2. **`gpt_model2.ipynb`** – A general-purpose chatbot using GPT-2 without dataset-specific constraints.
3. **`openai_model.ipynb`** – An integration with OpenAI's API, which works but has quota limitations.

## **3. Features**  

- **Dataset-Specific Chatbot**  
  Answers real estate-specific queries by analyzing a provided dataset.

- **General-Purpose Chatbot**  
  A chatbot capable of responding to various common questions using GPT-2.

- **API Integration**  
  OpenAI API integration for scalable chatbot responses.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Exploration of prompt engineering techniques to improve response coherence and relevancy.

## **5. Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
Clone the chatbot repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/chatbot-GPT-model.git
```

### 2. **Set Up OpenAI API Key (For OpenAI Integration)**  

To use OpenAI’s API, set your API key. Create a `.env` file or set it directly in your script.

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

---

## **6. Usage**

### **Running Scripts**  

- **GPT Dataset-Specific Chatbot**:  
  Run `gpt_model.ipynb` to analyze real estate questions.

- **General-Purpose Chatbot**:  
  Open `gpt_model2.ipynb` and test various general prompts.

- **API Integration Chatbot**:  
  Run `openai_model.ipynb` to interact with OpenAI’s API.

---

## **7. Challenges**

### **Dataset Integration**  
- In **`gpt_model.ipynb`**, generating reliable answers about real estate queries was difficult because GPT-2 struggled to understand and retain dataset-specific information.

### **Coherence Generation Issues**  
- In **`gpt_model2.ipynb`**, generating coherent and structured responses proved challenging.
- Text outputs were often inconsistent and lacked logical coherence across prompts.

### **Quota Limitations with OpenAI API**  
- The **`openai_model.ipynb`** script successfully integrates OpenAI's API but encounters **rate limits** due to subscription quotas.
